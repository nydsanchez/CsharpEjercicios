/* Challenge: Improve renewal rate of subscriptions
You've been asked to add a feature to your company's software. The feature is intended to improve the renewal rate of subscriptions to the software. Your task is to display a renewal message when a user logs into the software system and is notified their subscription will soon end. You'll need to add a couple of decision statements to properly add branching logic to the application to satisfy the requirements. */

//Review the business rules for this challenge
/* Rule 1: Your code should only display one message.
            The message that your code displays will depend on the other five rules. For rules 2-6, the higher numbered rules take precedence over the lower numbered rules.

Rule 2: If the user's subscription will expire in 10 days or less, display the message:
